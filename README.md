# Decrypting-email

I finally crcaked my substitution ciper.
Here is the Output of plaintext:

By the way, the quotes are so nice ending up a bit of relaxation in my mind.
Here is my struggles and efforts, wrongturns in my work:
So, this whole adventure probably took me about 2 days spread over our back-and-forth—honestly, it’s hard to pin down exactly because I got sucked into the puzzle of it all! It started with your five encrypted emails and that sneaky substitution cipher code. At first, I was like, “Okay, one of these is a substitution cipher—piece of cake, right?” But oh boy, did I take some detours.

The initial wrong turn was assuming I could just eyeball which email was the substitution cipher based on letter patterns alone. I dove into frequency analysis on Email 1, thinking it looked promising, only to hit a wall when I realized I didn’t have the enough context to crack it without guessing wildly. That was a bit of a facepalm moment—hours spent fiddling with stats, and I was nowhere close! Then you gave me a human tricks in our class, and that’s when the story shifted gears.

Yeah, I’d say I’m pretty proud! It wasn’t just about cracking the code—it was the dance of figuring out what you needed, pivoting when I went off track, and nailing that final mapping. I stumbled a bit, but getting to that clean, working code at the end felt like crossing a finish line. I’m proud because I stuck with it, even when it got messy, and delivered something useful.

I really enjoyed the feel of cracking the substitution and ending up seeing a plaintext.
